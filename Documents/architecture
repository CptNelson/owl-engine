==FRAMEWORK==
important things to keep in mind:

    Keep it well documented. What functions do we have? When can they be called? How are the called?
    Keep it simple. Easy Functions like  drawMesh(Mesh* oMesh) or loadShader(String sPath) 
    will make you happy in the long run.
    Keep it functional. Don't be too specific. instead of drawButtonSprite, 
    have a drawSprite function and let the Caller handel the rest.

What do we gain? Alot:

    We only need to setup our Framework once and can use it in every System we need (GUI, Renderer....)
    We can easily change the underlying API's if we chose, without rewriting every System. 
    Switch from OpenGL to DirectX? No Problem, just rewrite the Framework Class.
    It keeps the Code in our Systems clean and tight.
    Having a well documented Interface means, one person can work on the Framework, 
    while one person works in the System Layer.
